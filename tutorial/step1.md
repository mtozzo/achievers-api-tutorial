# React Powered Achievers API App tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a JS App powered by React.

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

This tutorial was written with npm v5.6.0 and Yarn v1.5.1 .

We're going to start by following the steps listed on the official ReactJS documentaion ( https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html ) . So on the command line execute the following:

```
npx create-react-app achievers-api-tutorial
cd achievers-api-tutorial
```

and then `npm start` or `yarn start`. Going forward we will refer to doing this as executing `yarn start` but the two are interchangable.

Going to your http://localhost:3000/ on your local machine should show you something like the following:
